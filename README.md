The project functionality was built on vanilla javascript.

This involves the pagination and filtering of a list of at least 42 students to show 9 students per page, each paginated link is to display another set of 9 students. This also contains searching through the list of students by either a letter in the name or more specifically by the first name or last name of a student and if the student does not exist, an error message is displayed.
